# My Solution: 
```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletionSize(self, strs):
        # Time complexity: O(n^2)
        # Space complexity: O(n) for additional array data structure
        
        n = len(strs)
        m = len(strs[0])
        # Keep track of total number of columns to be deleted
        counter = 0

        # Array to keep track of which pairs of consecutive strings
        # are already sorted
        sorted_pairs = [False] * (n - 1)

        for column in range(m):

            bad = False

            for i in range(n - 1):
                if not sorted_pairs[i] and strs[i][column] > strs[i + 1][column]:
                    # At least 1 unsorted pair has been found in the current iteration
                    bad = True
                    break
            
            if bad == True:
                counter += 1
                continue

            # Now we can assume the current column was deleted
            # That means all "bad" pairs were deleted as well

            # We check for which new pairs are ok
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if not sorted_pairs[i] and strs[i][column] < strs[i + 1][column]:
                    sorted_pairs[i] = True
            
            # When all pairs are ok => array is lexicographically sorted
            if all(sorted_pairs):
                break
        
        return counter
```
